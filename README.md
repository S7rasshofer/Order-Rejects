Small project to document and create the letters for rejected return orders for an online business.  
Running this project will create a folder for the Templates your Documents folder called Templates.  

## Documenting

Creating the letter will create a folder on your desktop called 'Shipbacks', this is where the files will save to.  
This will simultaneously save the letter as the Customername & OrderNumber and Print out the amount of Copies (default 2).  
Templates are created using Word, the variables can be placed within the document using double Curly Brackets.  
Which template used is dependant on the drop box (default, Out of Policy).
