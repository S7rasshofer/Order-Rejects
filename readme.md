# Scope

Small project to document and create the letters for rejected return orders for an online business.  
Running this project will create a folder for the Templates in your 'Documents' folder called "Return Reject Templates".
As well as a folder on your desktop for the generated files, named "Shipbacks".

## Documenting

Creating the letter will create a folder on your desktop called 'Rejects', this is where the created files will save to.  
This will simultaneously save the letter as the CustomerName_OrderNumber and Print out the designated amount of Copies (default 2).  
Templates are created using Word, the variables can be placed within the document using double Curly Brackets.  
Which template used is dependant on the drop box (default, Out of Policy).
Adding word documents to the templates folder will add to the 'Reasons' drop box, if the program is open you will have to update the list in the file menu.
